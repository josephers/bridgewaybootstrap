h2(featurette-heading). Conversation


The next step in our worship-focused life is conversation.
Let's get talking!

<hr>

h3(muted). Catechism

Catechism is the teaching of who God is, and how we are inited to live their life through their knowledge of God. There are three courses we offer regularly.
<h5>Catechism I: Knowing God</h5>
<h5>Catechism II: Speaking to God</h5>
<h5>Catechism III: Following Christ</h5>
The first course runs seven weeks, on Sundays after our worship service, and the next two are four weeks each.

<hr>

h3(muted). Children's Ministry

They say children are our future. Children's Ministry has the very important role of teaching children their first steps toward developing a healthy relationship with God. But it's not just for children â€” the ministry's primary focus is to encourage parents to disciple their children to instill a life-long spritual discipline.

<hr>

h3(muted). Cup-panion

A cup-panion, described so for the idea of meeting over a cup of coffee, is a small group meeting for those who want to meet one-on-one for the purpose of mutual encouragement and edification. The topic or reason for meeting is left up to the group. The duration of cup-panionship will vary, but we encourage you to keep it less than twelve weeks.

<hr>

h3(muted). Small Group

Small groups are gatherings for guidance and discussion of God's workings in our lives.

<hr>

h3(muted). Young Adult Ministry

The Young Adult Ministry, endearingly called YAM, seeks to provide community to those that are in their late teens to early adulthood.
