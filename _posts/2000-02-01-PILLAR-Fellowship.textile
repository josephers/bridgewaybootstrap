h2(featurette-heading). Fellowship

p(lead). We are not alone, fellows.
We fellowship through, but not limited through, the following ways.

<hr>

h3(muted). Baptism and Communion

These are two sacrements Jesus instituted for the church. They are an act which reveals our pledge to God and other believers. Baptism is held twice a year, on Easter Sunday and Christmas service. Communion, where we take bread and wine, is held every week, to remember Christ and his work.

<hr>

h3(muted). Diaconate Ministry

Diaconate Ministry seeks mercy ministry opportunities in our community.

<hr>

h3(muted). Life Group

A cup-panion, described so for the idea of meeting over a cup of coffee, is a small group meeting for those who want to meet one-on-one for the purpose of mutual encouragement and edification. The topic or reason for meeting is left up to the group. The duration of cup-panionship will vary, but we encourage you to keep it less than twelve weeks.
