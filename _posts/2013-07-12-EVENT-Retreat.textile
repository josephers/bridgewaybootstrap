We have no Sunday service on Sunday, July 14th, as we are away at Brock University for a summer retreat. If you'd like to join us for Sunday service, we will have worship starting at 10:30AM as usual. Our residence is Alan Earp Residence for the weekend.

If you are attending, registration begins at 4PM on Friday, July 12th, and our first session will begin at 8PM. Please grab something to eat before you arrive for the evening!
