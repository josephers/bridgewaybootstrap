As a church, we desire to see our congregation being shaped and touched by God. Lent is a time when we repent and turn our lives toward God. Why not join us during this Lent season to turn our lives, as a community, towards God?

Small groups will consist of a time for us to slow down, and with each other, see what God is inviting us into. We will have time to share, listen to his Word, and pray. We hope and rpay that you will join us as we make space to journey with each other in opening ourselves more to God.

Come find us every Friday, from March 1st to March 22nd, at our main chapel. We'll be meeting at 6:30PM for snacks first, and our main event will start at 7PM and end at 8PM.
